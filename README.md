This case study is explained in detail in this blog: https://medium.com/@pravinshankar1/content-based-automated-playlist-generation-using-deep-learning-b892a7de3d3c

'filename_split_order.npy' contains the name of the audio files ordered based on train-test split. First 6397(0 to 6396) rows are train data and the remaining are test data.


VGG based features and spectrogram image files are not provided because of their size. Use 'filename_split_order.npy' file to extract vgg features in the same order.


'genre_predict4.npy' is ordered according to 'filename_split_order.npy'
